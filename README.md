# Sales Analysis Project

## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing sales data using SQL and Python. It includes a collection of SQL queries for data analysis and a Jupyter Notebook for visualization and further exploration. Key objectives include:
- Identifying top revenue-generating products.
- Analyzing sales trends by region and category.
- Comparing year-over-year growth metrics.
- Highlighting the highest growth subcategories.

## Repository Contents

- **`analysis_queries.sql`**: Contains SQL queries for analyzing sales data.
- **`project1.docx`**: Documentation of SQL queries with explanations and outputs.
- **`Untitled2(1).ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook for visualizing and analyzing sales trends.

## How to Use

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and your sales data is loaded into a table named `df_orders`.

2. **Run SQL Queries:**
   - Use the queries in `analysis_queries.sql` to analyze the data directly in PostgreSQL.

3. **Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open the notebook `Untitled2(1).ipynb` in Jupyter or any Python environment.
   - Install necessary Python libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
     ```
   - Use the notebook to visualize and explore sales trends.

## Key Analyses

1. **Top Revenue-Generating Products:**
   - Identify the top 10 products based on revenue.

2. **Region-wise Sales Analysis:**
   - Find the top 5 products in each region based on sales.

3. **Year-over-Year Growth:**
   - Compare monthly sales between 2022 and 2023.

4. **Category Trends:**
   - Discover which month had the highest sales for each category.

5. **Subcategory Growth:**
   - Identify the subcategory with the highest profit growth from 2022 to 2023.
